/**
 * Immutable:
 * 1. Don't provide "setter" methods â€” methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
 * 2. Make all fields final and private.
 * 3. Don't allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. A more
 *      sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.
 * 4. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
 *  - Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
 *  - Don't share references to the mutable objects. Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor;
 *      if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies. Similarly, create copies of your internal
 *      mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.
